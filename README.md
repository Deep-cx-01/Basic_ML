## Project 1: Housing Prediction

### Description
The Housing Prediction project uses linear regression to predict housing prices based on various features such as location, size, and number of bedrooms.

## Project 2: Diabetic Regression

### Description
The Diabetic Regression project implements logistic regression to predict whether an individual is likely to have diabetes based on various health attributes. This project serves as a practical example of applying machine learning techniques to a real-world health problem.

## Evaluation
The model's performance can be evaluated using metrics such as:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- Confusion Matrix

## Conclusion
The Diabetic Regression project demonstrates how logistic regression can be effectively used for binary classification tasks in healthcare. By predicting diabetes, this model can aid in early detection and potentially improve health outcomes.

## Future Work
- Enhance the model with additional features or techniques such as feature engineering or ensemble methods.
- Explore the use of other algorithms like Decision Trees, Random Forests, or Neural Networks.
- Implement a web application for user-friendly predictions.
