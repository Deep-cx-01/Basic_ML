PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
## 📊 Overview

This project applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to a dataset for predicting diabetes. By reducing dimensionality, PCA enhances data visualization and model performance, minimizing noise and improving interpretability.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the  It contains various health and demographic features relevant to diabetes prediction.

### 🧬 Features

- **Pregnancies**: Number of times pregnant
- **Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
- **Blood Pressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- **Skin Thickness**: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
- **Insulin**: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- **BMI**: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- **Diabetes Pedigree Function**: A function that scores the likelihood of diabetes based on family history
- **Age**: Age (years)
- **Outcome**: Class variable (0 or 1) indicating whether the patient has diabetes

## ⚙️ Installation
